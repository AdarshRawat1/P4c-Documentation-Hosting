p4c is a reference compiler for the P4 programming language.
It supports both P4-14 and P4-16.

One fact attesting to the level of quality and completeness of p4c's
code is that its front-end code, mid-end code, and p4c-graphs back end
are used as the basis for at least one commercially supported P4
compiler.
