## Basic Tunneling
In this exercise, you enhance an IP router implemented in P4 by adding basic tunneling support, enabling encapsulation of IP packets for customized forwarding. By introducing a new tunnel header type, you modify the switch code to handle encapsulated packets and define forwarding rules based on destination IDs. Through static control plane entries, the switch routes encapsulated packets, showcasing P4's versatility in customizing packet processing and network functionality.
